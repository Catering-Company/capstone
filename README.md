# Capstone Limited

## Overview
Capstone Limited is a small-medium company, based in the UK, that does catering services. This is a a small static website to help them acheive their digital transformation.

Capstone currently relies on printed catalogues and other non-digital marketing mediums to help showcase their products and services to their customers. However, due to the pandemic and its disruptions on the mailing sector, Capstone has decided to own a digital platform display the wide array of their products. Because they hope this platform will
eventually grow to also be their main platform for communication with their customers and sales generation, they have decided to go for a website.
