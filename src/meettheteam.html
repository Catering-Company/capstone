        <h2> Head Chef: Michael Walls </h2>
        <p style="text-align:left">
            Michael has been passionate about food since he first picked up a spatula at age 4. He's a very capable
            cuisinier having studied at Le Cordon Bleu London in the early 2000's. Loving a challenge, Mike founded
            Capstone to not only provide high quality catering, but to make sure you don't worry about food and can
            enjoy your special day or event.
        </p>

        <h2> Dietician: Melissa Hawke</h2>
        <p style="text-align:left">
            Melissa is our very capable dietician. Her mission is to make sure every guest is catered for and all of
            our meals are up to scratch nutrition-wise. If you do have any dietary requirements, Mel will be more than 
            happy to have a friendly discussion about your needs.
        </p>

        <h2> Porters: Andrew & Martin Goodman</h2>
        <p style="text-align:left">
            Andy and Martin are Mike's right-hand men. They're workaholics; acting both as sous chefs and managing our
            serving team to make sure everything runs smoothly and to a high professional standard. 
        </p>

        <h2> Our servers</h2>
        <p style="text-align:left">
            We've got a super friendly team of front facing servers who work with us part time. They will vary depending 
            on location, but they are all lovely and will do their very best to make the day run like clockwork.
        </p>
