        <p> Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every place has its own specialties to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes 
        are vada pav, misal pav, chole bhature, parathas, bhel puri, sev puri, gol gappa, aloo tikki, kebabs, tandoori chicken, samosas, kachori, idli, pohe, 
        egg bhurji, pav bhaji, pulaw, pakora, lassi, kulfi and falooda. In Hindi speaking regions of India, street food is popularly known as nukkadwala food 
        ("corner" food). In South India, foods like mirchi bajji, punugulu, and mokkajonna (corn roasted on coal) are common street foods, along with breakfast 
        items like idli, dosa and bonda. While some vendors streamline the recipes of popular dishes to sell them on the street, several restaurants have taken 
        their inspiration from the street food of India.
